    requirements:
      # if need-stats && need-permission-to-unlock = true, then they need the perm and stats to buy.
      # if need-stats = true, then they need the stats to buy.
      # if need-permission-to-unlock = true, then they need the permission to unlock (using stats or buy).
      # if both are false, then they just need the stats or buy.
      # if need-permission-to-unlock = false & the player has the permission anyway, they automatically can select the cage

      # How to "unlock":
      # if there is no cost but there is stats, then they just need stats.
      # if there is a cost but there is no stats, then they just need to buy.
      # if there is no cost or stats, then it's free.

      # If there is a nuclear war, you select the quantum middle state of true and false on both options -> pc go boom

      # If true -> needs permission to buy/unlock: sw.kit.identifier (recommended: false)
