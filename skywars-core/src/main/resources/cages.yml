    # if must-buy && need-permission-to-unlock = true, then they need the perm and stats to buy.
    # if must-buy = true, then they need the stats to buy.
    # if need-permission-to-unlock = true, then they need the permission to unlock (using stats or buy).
    # if both are false, then they just need the stats or buy.

    # How to "unlock":
    # if there is no cost but there is stats, then they just need stats.
    # if there is a cost but there is no stats, then they just need to buy.
    # if there is no cost or stats, then it's free.

    # if there is a nuclear war, you select the quantum middle state of true and false on both options -> pc go boom
    need-permission-to-unlock: false # needs permission to buy/unlock: sw.kit.identifier
    must-buy: false # true -> need stats (if applicable) and needs to buy.
