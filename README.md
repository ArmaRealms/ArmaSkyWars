# SkyWarsReloaded
The most popular Skywars plugin ever built for Spigot and Bukkit!

This plugin is based off the of the old SkywarsReloaded plugin (4.1.3), but adds more features, fixes, and 1.14-1.16 support! You can just update to this version without removing any of your current Skywars files. Everything works the same. Please note that the official/old Skywars plugin is no longer maintained. We will, however, continue to maintain this version until further notice!
